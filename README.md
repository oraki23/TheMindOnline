# The Mind Online
Original Game: [https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244992/mind](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244992/mind)

###### Introduction:
***
This app uses [express](https://expressjs.com/), [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [socket.io](https://socket.io)

To run the app, simply run 'node index.js' and the server will by default start on port 8000.
You will also have to change the line 112 (at the time of this writing) in the index.html file:
'socket = io('ws://localhost:8000');' -> you will have to put your host there.
